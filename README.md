This app is just meant to explore using the "system" prompt with OAI API compatible LLMs. It also has a VERY basic sqlite function for chat history. I've only tested it with Llama.cpp so dont bully if it doesnt work with ChatGPT/LMStudio/Ollama whatever

just hit run.sh to set up the venv (you might need to do an ol' chmod +x)

if you want to change parameters other than the role messages youll have to edit it in the source code... i might add text boxes to change it at runtime, maybe

This is mainly for personal use but feel free to use it or copy it
